                                    From a young age, Alejandra Rodriguez knew she wanted a career in health care. After volunteering at
                                    some physical therapy clinics and hospitals, she became fascinated with Physical Therapy as a means of
                                    helping people recover from injury and return to an active lifestyle.
                                </p>    
                                <p>
                                    She obtained her Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Toronto, and her Physiotherapy degree from the Hogeschool van Amsterdam in The Netherlands.

                                <p>    
                                    After completing her program, she obtained her physiotherapy license in Canada as well as the United
                                    States in 2006.

                                    She gathered a wide range of experience by working her way through many different health care sectors, from hospitals to rehabilitation centres to private practices.
                                    She spent several years working in the chronic pain management program in Toronto Western Hospital
                                </p>
                                <p>   
                                    where she learned the importance of working with an interdisciplinary team of health care professionals to treat complex conditions. Her goal was always to help patients restore their quality of life in every single aspect.
                                </p> 
                                <p>    
                                    She continued her career, working closely with several family doctors, specialists, psychologists and
                                    multiple health care professionals to help her clients recover and achieve their lifestyle goals.

                                    Alejandra specialized in the area of orthopedics and has successfully treated patients with many types of complex injuries from car accidents to sports injuries, to slip-and-falls, work-related injuries and pre and
